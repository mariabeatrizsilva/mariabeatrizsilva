<h3> Hi There üòÅ </h3>

My name is Maria Beatriz. I'm a Sophomore and Presidential Honors Scholar at NYU majoring in CS with a minor in Mathematics. My research interests are currently centered around Computer Graphics. I currently am a teaching assistant at [ELiTE Education](http://www.elite-education.org) (an organization that teaches CS to NYC high schoolers from underrepresented backgrounds) and a co-author of a paper that will be published at [ACM CHI](https://chi2024.acm.org). This summer, I will be joining [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) as a Thrive intern on the software engineering track. 

Here are my favorite projects thus far:
- :wine_glass: [Murano Cup](https://mariabeatrizsilva.github.io/murano/index.html): A 3d model of a murano glass cup
- ü¶†[Agent-based Model for Disease](https://github.com/mariabeatrizsilva/AgentBasedModeling): An agent-based SIRD model to simulate the spread of disease within a population
