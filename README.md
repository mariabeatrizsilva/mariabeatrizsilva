My name is Maria Beatriz. I'm a Junior and Presidential Honors Scholar at NYU Courant majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. While my specific research interests are not set in stone, I'm particularly drawn to work centered around Computer Graphics, Machine Learning, and Visualization. Ultimately, my goal is to work on projects that have potential for concrete social impact. 


In pursuit of this goal, I have taken on the following roles in the least year: 
- Teaching assistant at [ELiTE Education](http://www.elite-education.org) (an organization that teaches CS to NYC high schoolers from underrepresented backgrounds),
- [MLT Career Prep Fellow on the SWE track](https://info.mlt.org/career-prep-software-engineering-swe?_gl=1*1go9dov*_ga*NDkyMDQ2NDgyLjE3MTIzODE1NTY.*_ga_4QFCKC472T*MTcxMjM4MTU1NS4xLjAuMTcxMjM4MTU1NS4wLjAuMA..),
- Co-author of a paper that will be published at [ACM CHI 2024](https://chi2024.acm.org), and finally,
- Thrive intern at [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) on the software engineering track. I will be returning to Duolingo as a Software Engineering Intern in in Summer 2025. 

My favorite projects I've done thus far are:
- :wine_glass: [Murano Cup](https://mariabeatrizsilva.github.io/murano/index.html): An interactive and customizeable 3d model of a Murano glass cup.
- ü¶†[Agent-based Model for Disease](https://github.com/mariabeatrizsilva/AgentBasedModeling): An agent-based SIRD model to simulate the spread of disease within a population.
- :sauropod: [PaleoScan: Low-Cost Easy-to-use High-Volume Fossil Scanning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642020), a fossil scanning system that consists of both a scanner hardware and a data-processing pipeline. More details are available in our CHI 2024 paper.
