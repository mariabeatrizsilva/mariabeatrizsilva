Hi, I'm Maria (she/her). I'm passionate about social change, political involvement, machine learning, and responsible AI. I seek opportunities that combine the world of computer science with my passion for practical and social impact.

As an aspiring computer scientist, I've engaged in multiple research internships mostly centered around machine learning and Natural Language Processing. Most recently, I explored different parsing strategies to generate training data from Wikipedia dumps and used spaCy, an NLP library, to learn how to design a character level LSTM to recognize different languages. 

I hope to take my machine learning knowledge and pair it with my desire for social change.

I've been an advocate for minorities in many ways. At my high school, I volunteered to be the spokesperson for open houses, tours, and other diversity efforts that encouraged underrepresented minorities to attend Hunter and gave them resources to succeed. Similarly, I've worked on multiple campaigns for local offices in New York City--notably city council and district attorney.
